# brain-labelling-MIT
Segmentation + Labelling project 

The segmentation networks implemented in this repository include:

1 . [**SegNet**](https://github.com/Anurag-Gade/brain-labelling-MIT/tree/main/segmentation_networks/segnet)

2 . [**VGGSegNet**](https://github.com/Anurag-Gade/brain-labelling-MIT/tree/main/segmentation_networks/VGG16_SegNet)

3 . [**UNet**](https://github.com/Anurag-Gade/brain-labelling-MIT/tree/main/segmentation_networks/unet)

*More models are being added*

Place the train, validation and testing data into their respective folders in the '.data/CamVid/' directory.
